## Lessons Learned


* Teamwork makes the dreamwork: The coordination of who is working on what part of the project was a challenge, as we many parts had to be edited simultaneously to come out with a working project. To overcome this, we used frequent communication on slack and pair programming to smooth out the process.
* Bootstrap might make things easier, but that doesn't make beautification easy: The layout of the homepage, results page and update page took effort, trial and error to get working correctly. We learned skills and techniques to more quickly make a functional website look good through some good 'ole fashioned google research.
* Pass the data, please:  Data storage and transfer from a jsp file to a java file and then back to a jsp file is not easy. While building collections of data in java is relatively simple, the capabilities of a jsp file are very limited without utilizing scripting. Without a working knowledge of a scripted language like javascript, data storage was limited to what the Spring framework provided with parameter requests and command objects. 
* The were some features we planed for but with the time constraint it really made use prioritize the important parts to get minimal viable product maybe next time we do a crud we will have a little more time to work on the back end and front end as a group.
* challenges with the front end is that it was more trial and error with no time to draw and make design choices we were forced to do it quick an dirty, and google and brute force things to work.
